=== Caso Help ===
Made by Sven Nilsen, 2022

Caso uses Avalog as monotonic solver:
https://github.com/advancedresearch/avalog

Special commands:
- bye            quits the program
- ``             prints separator for readability

Type in an expression in Caso notation, e.g.
`(A <-> B)[(A <-> C) -> (B <-> D)] <=> (C -> D)`
